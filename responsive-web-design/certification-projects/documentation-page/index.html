            <article>
                <p>C# (pronounced "C Sharp") is a modern, object-oriented programming language that was developed by 
                    Microsoft as part of their .NET platform. It was later approved as a standard by ECMA (ECMA-334) 
                    and ISO (ISO/IEC 23270). C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI).
                </p>
                <p> The syntax of C# is highly expressive, yet it is also simple and easy to learn. The curly-brace 
                    syntax of C# will be instantly recognizable to anyone familiar with C, C++ or Java. Despite its 
                    similarities to these languages, C# introduces a number of improvements and innovations, 
                    such as properties and events.
                </p>
                <p> The name "C Sharp" was inspired by the musical notation where a sharp indicates that the written 
                    note should be made a semitone higher in pitch. This is a metaphor for the language's design goal 
                    to offer a higher level of performance and sophistication than its predecessors, particularly C++.

                    <li>C# is fully integrated with the .NET library, providing access to a vast array of 
                        functionality and making it easy to develop both desktop and web applications.</li>
                    <li>With C#, you can build a variety of applications, from cloud-based services to 
                        enterprise software and games.</li>
                    <li>C# is statically-typed, which means your code will be checked for errors before it gets
                         built into an app. This makes it easier to catch and fix coding mistakes.</li>
                    <li>C# supports automatic memory management, which means it handles memory leaks and 
                        garbage collection for you.</li>

                <p>
                    C# and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. 
                    The C# language resembles Java but has its own unique features like properties, 
                    indexers, and events.
                </p>

                <p>
                    In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, C# 
                    supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, 
                    Boolean, and string values. C# has a class-based object model and supports functions 
                    without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, 
                    executing as methods.
                </p>
                <p>
                    C# is a statically-typed language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all 
                    variables, classes, and methods. You have to be concerned with whether methods are 
                    public, private, or protected, and you have to implement interfaces. Variables, 
                    parameters, and function return types are explicitly typed.

            <article>
                To get started with writing C#, open your IDE and write your first "Hello world" C# code:
                <code>class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { Console.WriteLine("Hello World!"); } }</code>

                Run the code to see it unfold in your IDE!

            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, 
                called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                A C# identifier must start with a letter or underscore (_); subsequent characters can also 
                be digits (0-9). Because C# is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" 
                (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).

            <article>
                You can declare a variable in C# as follows::
                <p>
                    With the keyword int. For example, <code>int x = 42.</code> 
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, always integer.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the keyword string. For example, <code>string str = "Hello World";</code> 
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, always string.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    With the keyword bool. For example, <code>bool isTrue = true;</code> 
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, always boolean.
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    With the keyword float. For example, <code>float pi = 3.14f;</code> 
                    This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables, always float.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By simply assigning it a value. For example,
                    <code>x = 42.</code> This always declares a global variable. It
                    generates a strict C# warning. You shouldn't use this
                    variant.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In C#, the type of the variable must be declared when it is created, 
                    and it cannot be changed later (i.e., C# is a statically typed language).
