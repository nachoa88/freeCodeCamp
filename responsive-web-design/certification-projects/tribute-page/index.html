            <h3 id="headline">Here's some information about Dr. Borlaug's life:</h3>
            <p>To finance his studies, Borlaug put his education on hold periodically to earn some income, as he did in
                1935 as a leader in the Civilian Conservation Corps, working with the unemployed on federal projects.
                Many of the people who worked for him were starving. He later recalled, "I saw how food changed them.
                All of this left scars on me".</p>
            <p>From 1935 to 1938, before and after receiving his Bachelor of Science in forestry in 1937, Borlaug worked
                for the United States Forest Service at stations in Massachusetts and Idaho. He spent one summer in the
                middle fork of Idaho's Salmon River, the most isolated piece of wilderness in the nation at that time.
